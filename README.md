# qcffpi
a homegrown mixed quantum/classical dynamics code based upon the QCFF_Pi code of Arieh Warshel and edited to include OpenMP thread parallelism, suface hopping algorithms, and optimized for use with conjugated polymers

My use was often times as is, but required understanding of the fundamental physics as well as being able to edit the source code to fix bugs and errors.  As a legacy academic code, there were frequent bugs and errors associated with changing simulation parameters.
