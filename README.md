# qcffpi
a homegrown mixed quantum/classical dynamics code based upon the QCFF_Pi code of Arieh Warshel and edited to include OpenMP thread parallelism, suface hopping algorithms, and optimized for use with conjugated polymers

Not all source files are present here, but enough to give a flavor for the type of dynamics package and legacy code I was expected to understand and use.
